It is a GenAI-based full-stack application built with React, FastAPI, and Python. It uses Deepgram ,LiveKit SDK, Google Gemini, and Google Cloud APIs for live call handling, transcription, analysis, summarization, objection handling, and recommendations, with MongoDB for transcript, call history, users, admin,CRM data, auth,analytics, and reporting
The AI Sales Call Assistant is a full-stack Generative AI application designed to enhance sales conversations through real-time transcription, intelligent analysis, and actionable post-call insights. The system supports sales teams during and after calls by converting live audio into text, analyzing conversations using Large Language Models (LLMs), and generating summaries, sentiment insights, recommendations, and performance feedback.

The frontend of the application is built using React, offering an interactive interface for live calls, transcripts, analytics, and reports. The backend is developed using Python with FastAPI, managing API orchestration, business logic, and integrations with external services. LiveKit is used for real-time call handling, while Deepgram provides accurate speech-to-text transcription for live sales conversations.

The system leverages Google Gemini for advanced sentiment analysis, transcript understanding, text summarization, dynamic question generation, objection handling, benchmark analysis, article creation, and feedback generation. Sentiment analysis evaluates customer tone and emotions throughout the call, helping sales teams understand customer interest, engagement, and objections more effectively.

A CRM-based product recommendation system analyzes conversation context and sentiment to suggest relevant products. MongoDB is used for storing transcripts, call history, sentiment scores, analysis outputs, user sessions, and CRM data. Authentication is implemented using NextAuth with Google provider, enabling secure user and admin access with role-based control.

The application also includes post-call summary and insight generation, an automated analytics and reporting dashboard, refined recommendation logic, improved UI/UX flow, workflow optimization, and complete frontend and backend testing. The project follows a milestone-based development approach, concluding with code restructuring, error resolution, and updated documentation for final deployment and scalability.
